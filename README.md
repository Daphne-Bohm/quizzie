# Quiz Game

It is a quiz game I made with HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript, PHP and the Open Trivia DB API.

## Motivation

I made this game because I wanted to practice working with APIs. 
I also wanted to learn how to make a login and register form with php. And I wanted to learn how the communication between PHP and JavaScript goes, but also how PHP and HTML work togheter.

## Where can you find the game?

You can find the game on: https://quizzie-app.herokuapp.com/.

## How does the game work?

1. When you play the game the first time, you have to choose a color. You can change the color everytime by clicking on the color palette in the navigation bar.
2. When you have chosen a color, a button 'start' appears.
3. When you click start. You have to choose a category: 
    * blue is category general
    * red is category music
    * orange is category math
    * pink is category history
    * green is category animals
4. When you clicked on a category, the game starts. You only get questions from the chosen category.
5. When you click on a possible answer a 'message' will appear. It will show if the chosen answer is correct or not. After two seconds, the message disappears and a new question will be loaded.
6. Do you want to stop? Click on the 'stop the quiz' button.
7. Then it will take you to another webpage with the scores: how many correct/how many false.

## Other information about the project

I also made a login and register form with php. Users can make an account and save their scores.
But this doesn't work in the live version because is not connected with a database.
